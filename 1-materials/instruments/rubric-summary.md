Rubric summary (excerpt)

Design is defined in terms of:
- Bounded contexts + classification (core/supporting/generic)
- Events/commands + data structures + exchange mechanisms
- Workflows: inputs/outputs + steps
- Domain errors
- External systems + interactions (via annotations)
- Domain services (optional)

Grading components
Completeness (5): Covers all requested DDD elements; workflows cover integrity of functional requirements; data structures comprehensive; external interactions annotated.
Coherence & correctness (3.5): Bounded contexts align with scope/cohesion; events/exchanges organized; workflows are pipelines handling inputs/outputs; start/stop conditions captured; end-to-end scenarios traceable without unaddressed corner cases.
Clarity (1.5): Uses DDD vocabulary and ubiquitous language; naming unambiguous; formatting easy to follow.
