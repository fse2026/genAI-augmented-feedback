Calibration log (LLM customization iterations)

| Iteration | Change made | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Include an exemplary deliverable | Provide a point of reference for LLM analysis of rubric elements in a submission |
| #1 | Remove high-level student-visible rubric and replace it with LLM-oriented one | Provide more details and context for each rubric element to strengthen LLM analysis |
| #1 | Compile a “common correctness and coherence issues list” | Improve coverage of issues raised as part of LLM analysis that are undetectable from functional requirements alone |
| #2 | Scaffold formatting improvements; remind students to provide a link to a Miro board instead of adding visual aids | LLM suggested visual aids for clarity; students submitted a separate Miro board in addition to textual documentation |
| #2 | Hide internals of LLM working | LLM revealed the “common issues list” and indicated presence/absence of a problem; this needed to be hidden |
| #2 | Point out where in the deliverable weaknesses should be addressed (workflow placement) | LLM analysis often did not indicate precisely where improvements should be made |
| #3 | Impose feedback structure: strengths, weaknesses, restating weaknesses in specific workflows | LLM analysis was inconsistent in format |
| #3 | Add action item addressing LLM shortcoming (review workflows for defined/used events/commands) | LLM was asked to point to missing item names but failed to list all such problems consistently |
