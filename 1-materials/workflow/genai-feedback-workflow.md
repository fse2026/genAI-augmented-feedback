genAI feedback workflow (student-facing)

Prerequisite
- The team reaches a first complete draft of the model that addresses the entire specification and contains all required design elements.

Limitations
- Do not use the customized model (or any other) to translate the specification directly into workflows. This will be reflected in grading.

Task
1) Each team member individually submits the workflows specification and asks the dedicated genAI model for feedback using the prescribed prompt:
   "Please give feedback on my project attached."
2) Critically evaluate relevance of all feedback elements; note inconsistencies/unhelpful pieces.
3) Meet as a team to discuss relevant improvements; identify elements not common across members (genAI can omit/hallucinate).
4) Record a high-level summary of each improvement the team plans to implement and assign them among members.
5) Repeat the process as needed.

Submission
- Submit a report describing specific changes you made to the team's pseudocode based on genAI's suggestions.
