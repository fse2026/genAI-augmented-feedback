# Anonymization and ethics note

## Scope
This package is prepared for double-blind peer review and contains anonymized derived datasets.

## Withheld materials (double-blind)
To reduce deblinding risk, we withhold:
- course lecture slides and course-specific project specification;
- raw genAI conversation PDFs/logs;
- raw student change logs.

These artifacts may contain course/project identifiers and/or student-identifying information.

## Anonymization applied to derived data
- Removed student names, usernames, and institutional identifiers.
- Replaced participants with pseudonyms (P###) and teams/groups with T## / G##.
- Dropped free-text fields; kept only columns used in the paper.

## Human-subjects / consent
Before any non-anonymized public release, add the applicable statement:
- IRB approval / exemption, or
- consent process, or
- institutional policy statement explaining why IRB review was not required.
