# Replication package (anonymized)

This repository contains materials and data artifacts supporting replication of the study described in the accompanying paper (FSE Software Engineering Education track submission).

## Contents (high-level)
- **1-materials/**: tutor configuration (system prompt, KB inventory), assignment/workflow instructions, and instruments (rubric summary, coding codebook, calibration log).
- **2-data/**:
  - **raw/**: retained GenAI transcripts (`ai-logs/AI##.pdf`) and student change reports (`student-change-logs/CH###.pdf`) with anonymized filenames.
  - **derived/**: indices and templates for tidy ratings/coding data.
- **3-analysis/**: scripts to reproduce descriptive summaries and inter-rater agreement.

## Replication package link (during review)
If this repository is shared via an anonymized link, use that link in the paper. Example paper text:

> **Replication package (anonymized).** We provide the prescribed prompts, tutor configuration (system prompt and KB inventory), rubric instruments and scoring anchors, transcript-coding codebook, anonymized derived data, and analysis scripts at: **[ANON LINK]**. The full rater-calibration log is included in the replication package to preserve space and support reproducibility.
